        The Iota Chapter of Beta Sigma Psi is a diverse group
        of men that is always looking to exceed expectations 
        and grow more influence on the University of Missouri
        campus. We take pride in having a wide range of men in
        this fraternity, and our overall goal is to spread the
        values bestowed in us by former members and in our national
        and chapter constitutions. We are open to any and all men on
        the University of Missouri that are willing to uphold and add
        to our values as a fraternity. We hope to continue to grow in
        size and in our influence across campus. We encourage our
        Associate Members to become members of other organizations that 
        could extend our reach and help spread our values. We are wholly
        committed to the scholastic implications that come with being a full
        time University student, and it is our goal as a fraternity to help
        our associate and active members succeed in their given academic
        fields. We also enjoy taking part in in all social aspects of college life
        and campus life, including independent socials, and participating
        in the University of Missouri Homecoming and Greek Week. Lastly, 
        our fraternity has an ongoing commitment with servicing the 
        University and the Columbia community at large through philanthropic 
        acts and events. We strongly encourage our members to only champion 
        these values, but be living examples of our ideals
